# Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction for Aircraft Engines

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 8 June 2025 Update ‚Äì Data Leakage Fixed

A prior version of this project included data leakage caused by:

- Normalizing features before splitting into training/validation/test sets
- Calculating RUL before applying rolling/statistical transformations

These issues have been resolved:
- Data is now split **before** scaling
- RUL is calculated **after** feature engineering to avoid future data contamination
- All models were retrained and re-evaluated using a fully **leak-free pipeline**

---

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using NASA‚Äôs CMAPSS dataset. RUL estimation is crucial for predictive maintenance, enabling industries to detect early signs of failure, optimize maintenance schedules, and avoid costly breakdowns.

We implemented and compared three models:
- LightGBM (gradient boosting)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- LSTM (deep learning, sequence-based)

All results are visualized using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

## Why This Project Matters

In real-world applications like aviation and manufacturing, machinery failure can lead to:

- Safety hazards  
- Operational downtime  
- High repair costs

Predictive maintenance using RUL prediction ensures:
- Machines are serviced before failure  
- Operations remain safe and efficient  
- Maintenance is data-driven and not reactive

This project simulates that process using a real-world industrial dataset and provides both predictive models and business-ready visualizations.

## Objective

Build ML models that estimate RUL using time-series sensor data and engineered features.  
Evaluate performance with:
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)  
- RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)  
- R¬≤ (Goodness of Fit)

---

## Feature Engineering

- Rolling means (window=5)  
- Rolling standard deviation  
- Delta (cycle-to-cycle difference)  
- EMA (Exponential Moving Average)  
- Cycle normalization

These features help models capture temporal degradation trends critical for accurate RUL estimation.

## Model Selection Rationale

This project compares three model types to learn from both tabular structure and time-dependent behavior in the dataset:

- **LightGBM**  
  Chosen for its performance and efficiency on tabular data. It handles feature interactions well and offers fast training and strong generalization.

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**  
  A baseline nonlinear model. SVR with an RBF kernel captures complex relationships and serves as a middle ground between tree-based and deep models.

- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**  
  Designed for sequence modeling. While performance was weaker in this case, LSTM captures temporal dependencies and is suited for long-term degradation tracking.
