# 🛠 Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction for Aircraft Engines

---

## 📌 Executive Summary

This project focuses on predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines using NASA’s CMAPSS dataset. RUL estimation is crucial for predictive maintenance — enabling industries to detect early signs of failure, optimize maintenance schedules, and avoid costly breakdowns.

We implemented and compared three models:
- **LightGBM** (gradient boosting)
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **LSTM** (deep learning, sequence-based)

All results are visualized using an interactive **Power BI dashboard**.

## ❓ Why This Project Matters

In real-world applications like aviation and manufacturing, machinery failure can lead to:

- Safety hazards
- Operational downtime
- High repair costs

**Predictive maintenance** using RUL prediction ensures:
- Machines are serviced **before** failure
- Operations remain **safe and efficient**
- Maintenance is **data-driven** and not reactive

This project simulates that process using a real-world industrial dataset and provides both predictive models and business-ready visualizations.
